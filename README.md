# Model

### PARTICIPANTS
    - Ewan Jee (netId: ej307)
    - Rushi Patel(netId: rpp138)
### PURPOSE
    - We aim to develop a predictive model that estimates the insurance coverage amount
    for customers based on demographic and socioeconomic factors such as income,
    occupation, and gender. The problem we are addressing is the inefficiency in
    personalized insurance offerings due to inadequate customer segmentation and risk
    assessment. By accurately predicting coverage amounts, insurance companies can
    tailor their products to meet individual needs, optimize pricing strategies, and improve
    customer satisfaction.

### Dataset
    -  The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravalsmit/customer-segmentation-data/data



### 2. Creating the Virtual Environment
To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

---

### 3. Activating the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

- **Linux/Mac**:
  ```bash
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

---

### 4. Installing Required Libraries
Install all necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 6. Running Jupyter Notebook
Follow these steps to open and execute the project notebook:

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Once the server starts, a browser window will open showing the file directory.

3. Navigate to the project folder and open the **`project.ipynb`** file.

4. Execute the notebook cell by cell to process the data and evaluate the model.
